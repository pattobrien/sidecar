# Analyzer Ecosystem (proposal)

While the current Analyzer "ecosystem" comprises of not much more than a few projects (```dart_custom_metrics``` and ```custom_lints```, to name a few), the trends of the Dart ecosystem - in terms of popularity, and hyperfocus on toolchains (re: metaprogramming) - will lower the barrier of entry for developers to be "more in control" of their IDE and developer experience. This is where Sidecar thinks it can help as well.

In order for the community to really flourish, the APIs behind defining LintRules and code edits need be as intutive as possible. Therefore, the biggest recommendation is: for package maintainers to offer a number of lint-based utilities for the community to used. 

- TODO: explain role of utility packages, like ```flutter_analyzer_utils```
