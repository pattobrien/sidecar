# Analyzing Ecosystem Packages (WIP)

For information on how we can handle the analysis of types defined in non-Dart packages (such as ```flutter```, ```riverpod```, etc.), see the [reflectable_flutter_analyzer prototype](https://github.com/pattobrien/reflectable_flutter_analyzer).

TODO: 
- ecosystem package example (e.g. analyzing SizedBox)
- UX decision: how can we make this as easy as possible for Rule creators
- UX decision: how can we make utilities easy to maintain for Package authors
