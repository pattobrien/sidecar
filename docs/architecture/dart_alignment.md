### Alignment with Dart-official Technologies

the best way to make Sidecar sustainable to maintain is by aligning with Dart-official technologies, including:

- Dart-official packages
- Dart APIs (like SourceSpan)
- Dart SDK tools (like pub)

It is not in anyone's best interest to unnecessarily re-invent the wheel of any tool. 

This project has taken steps to maximize the use cases of the tool, while minimizing the amount of code that it takes to do so.
