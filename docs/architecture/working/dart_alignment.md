# Alignment with Dart-official Technologies (WIP)

The best way to make Sidecar sustainable to maintain is by aligning with Dart-official technologies, including:

- Reducing the amount of dependencies and preferring to only use Dart-official packages
- Dart official APIs (e.g. ```package:analyzer```, ```package:source_span```, ```package:file```)
- Dart SDK tools (like pub)

It's in everyone's best interest to prevent unnecessarily re-inventing the wheel of any tool. 

This project has taken steps to maximize the use cases of the tool, while minimizing the amount of code that it takes to do so.
