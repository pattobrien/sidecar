> NOTE: This site is an active, high-priority project to help get you and others started with creating your own lint rules.
If there's any trouble you have with using Sidecar or a Sidecar-based rule package (like design_system_lints), your
feedback would be greatly appreciated in the [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/YhFS6V26Vg).

## Getting Started

Sidecar is a framework for creating custom lint and quick fix rules for Dart and Flutter projects.


If you want to create your own lint rules, we've created several [tutorials](category/tutorials) that break down the process of doing so.
But before diving in to the tutorials, its highly recommended that you understand the core concepts and usage guidelines of both
sidecar and package:analyzer.
