Sidecar is currently an experimental package and is not recommended to be used to create lints for production projects.

However, if you'd still like to proceed and create your own lints, these docs can certainly help get you started.
For any additional questions that you have, dont hesitate to reach out on [Discord](https://discord.gg/YhFS6V26Vg).

## Getting Started

Sidecar is a framework for creating custom lint and quick fix rules for Dart and Flutter projects.

For information on how to set up a rule package in order to display lints throughout your codebase or CLI, check out the [usage guides](category/usage-guides)
for setup steps and troublshooting tips.

If you want to create your own lint rules, we've created several [tutorials](category/tutorials) that break down the process of doing so.
But before diving in, its highly recommended that you fully understand the [core concepts](category/core-concepts) and usage guides of both
sidecar and [package:analyzer](https://pub.dev/packages/analyzer).
