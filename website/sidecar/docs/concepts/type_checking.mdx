When creating a lint rule, you will often need to check if a node is of a certain type. 
For example, you may want to find all class declarations which extend
`StatelessWidget` in order to perform some analysis on them.

The easiest way to do so would be to use the TypeChecker class, which provides an easy
method for checking if an AstNode is of a certain type:

<CodeBlock language="dart">{generateSnippet(dartTypeChecker, ['TypeChecker', 'ClassStart', 'ClassEnd', 'VisitMethod'])}</CodeBlock>

The two most important types of TypeChecker are:

- `TypeChecker.fromName` - Takes the name of a Type and the name of the package the Type's from


- `TypeChecker.fromDart` - Used for `dart` packages like `dart:core` or `dart:async`:


<CodeBlock language="dart">{generateSnippet(dartTypeChecker, ['DartType'])}</CodeBlock>
