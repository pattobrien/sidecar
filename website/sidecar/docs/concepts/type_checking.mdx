When creating a lint rule, you will often need to check if a node is of a certain type. 
For example, you may want to find all class declarations which extend
`StatelessWidget` in order to perform some analysis on them.

Unfortunately, we cannot just use the `is` keyword to check if a node is of a certain type,
because the analyzer can only provide us with `DartType` objects, which are not the same as
the `Type` objects we'd typically use when checking types in Dart programs.

Fortunately, Sidecar ships with its own `TypeChecker` utility, which provides an easy
way for checking if an AstNode is of a certain type:

<CodeBlock language="dart">{generateSnippet(dartTypeChecker, ['TypeChecker', 'ClassStart', 'ClassEnd', 'VisitMethod'])}</CodeBlock>

There are two notable ways to create a TypeChecker:

- `TypeChecker.fromName` - Used for non-Dart packages
- `TypeChecker.fromDartType` - Used for `dart` packages like `dart:core` or `dart:async`


<CodeBlock language="dart">{generateSnippet(dartTypeChecker, ['DartType'])}</CodeBlock>

In both cases, the utility takes the name of the Type and the name of the Type's package.
