If you're creating a new lint rule and lints are not appearing in the IDE of an example project,
 you can follow this checklist for requirements.


| Description                                 | Examples | Lints Available |
|---------------------------------------------|---------|:----------------:|
| Rule has a unique RuleCode ID in snake_case | `LintCode('avoid_edge_insets_literal')` | âœ… |
| The Rule's ClassName is the PascalCase equivalent of the RuleCode ID | `class AvoidEdgeInsetsLiteral extends LintRule {...}` | âœ… |
| The `code.package` value matches the name given to the rule package | `LintCode(..., package: 'design_system_lints')` | âœ… |
| Lint Rule is exported from `lib/<package_name>.dart`  | | ðŸš§ |


It's recommended that you use the lints included in [`package:sidecar_lints`](https://pub.dev/packages/sidecar_lints) to enforce the above rules
on your Sidecar-based rule package.
