If you're creating a new lint rule and lints are not appearing in the IDE of an example project,
 you can follow this checklist for requirements:

- [ ] Rule has a unique RuleCode ID (in snake_case)
- [ ] The Rule's ClassName is the PascalCase equivalent of the RuleCode ID
- [ ] The `code.package` value matches the name given to the rule package
- [ ] Lint Rule is exported from `lib/<package_name>.dart`
- [ ]
