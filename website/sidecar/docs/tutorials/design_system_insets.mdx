## Objective

A design system is a standardization concept that abstracts the design specifics of an application into reusable components.
In a Flutter application, we could isolate any design specifics to a `theme.dart` file, and reference our theme anywhere
in our application.



### Learning Objectives

- Multiple similar use cases (EdgeInsets.all, .only, .symmetric)
- How can we scale the logic without duplicating logic for each use case?
- Using annotations to mark our designSystem
- Using Sidecar test suite to account for all use cases
- Using debugger ?

### Planning

As part of our design system lint package, we want to enforce strict sizes for a number of various Widgets, including:

- SizedBox height and width
- Container height and width
- EdgeInsets of any Margin or Padding
- others ?

Unfortunately, there are no common themes between the fields we want to enforce, besides the fact that they take doubles. Therefore, we will need to handle each of these cases separately.

> It's important to consider if each case should be handled within its own rule, or if all cases should be handled in one rule.

If we focus on EdgeInsets, we can see that there are variety of different fields that we will want to prevent integer assignment to:

BAD:

- EdgeInsets.all(10.0)
- EdgeInsets.symmetric(horizontal: 10.0, vertical: 10.0)
- EdgeInsets.only(top: 10.0, left: 10.0, right: 10.0, bottom: 10.0)
- EdgeInsets.only(top: someRandomVariable)

GOOD:

- EdgeInsets.only(top: someDesignSystemVariable)

In this case, it would be very beneficial to create unit tests that will help us think of all the use cases in which we want to display a lint error.
