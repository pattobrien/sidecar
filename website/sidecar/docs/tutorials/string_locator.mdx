## Objective

Find all string literals used in 'Text' widgets

### Learning Objectives

- Introduction to 'TypeCheckers'
- Also find all String variables used in Text widgets that dont go through intl package
- Use CLI to help with creating Sidecar Rule Packages and rules

### Notes:

- I dont love this example; without Refactoring features it may seem half-baked
- However, we could use this as an opportunity to compare to existing packages that try to satisfy the same goal
- E.g. string_literal_finder (https://github.com/hpoul/string_literal_finder/issues?q=is%3Aissue+)
- e.g. localizely
