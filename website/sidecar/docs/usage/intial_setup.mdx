# Initial Setup

Sidecar is used via Sidecar-based rule packages like [design_system_lints](https://pub.dev/packages/design_system_lints).

There are 2 modes which these packages can be run within a Dart or Flutter Project: IDE Server or Cli mode.

## IDE Server Mode <a name="server-usage"></a>

### Requirements

- Supported IDE with Extension for Dart Language Server
- Dart SDK v2.17.0+

### Setup Instructions

To enable any Sidecar-based package like [design_system_lints](https://pub.dev/packages/design_system_lints)
to display lints and assist recommendations within your IDE, perform the following setup steps:

1. Depend on the lint package:

<CodeBlock title="pubspec.yaml" language="yaml">{trimSnippet(pubspec)}</CodeBlock>

2. Create a ```sidecar.yaml``` file at the Target Project's root directory and declare any rules from the package:

<CodeBlock title="sidecar.yaml" language="yaml">{trimSnippet(main)}</CodeBlock>

3. Enable the Sidecar plugin to run by adding ```sidecar``` to the list of plugins in ```analysis_options.yaml```

<CodeBlock title="analysis_options.yaml" language="yaml">{trimSnippet(analysisOptions)}</CodeBlock>

That's all it takes! Your lints should begin appearing in your editor.


## CLI Mode <a name="cli-usage"></a>

CLI Mode is useful for running lint rules from a CI/CD pipeline. To use Sidecar in CLI mode, run the following command in your terminal:

```sh
# activate sidecar
dart pub global activate sidecar

# run sidecar analyzer in CLI mode
sidecar analyze
```

You should see analysis results appear for each file in your project:
